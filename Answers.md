#What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript Frameworks? 
* React JS is a framework that alters the HTML on the web to make an interactive UI layer with the assistance of javascript. It differs from other frameworks because it renders HTML directly in its components using a language of its own called JSX. With JSX it allows rapid prototyping in a way that is unique and thorough. 
#Explain briefly the React Component Lifecycle. Name three of the methods that are a part of the lifecycle and what they do. 
* The React Component Lifecycle determines the state and visibility of components on the application. 
* ComponentDidMount Right after a component is mounted this method is invoked, useful for DOM manipulation, and API requests. 
* ComponentWillMount Right before the component is mounted and rendered. 
* Render() used to modify the DOM with HTML elements written in JSX
#Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component. 
* A class component has state that can be altered within the component. The functional components do not hold state, however they are very useful for altering DOM elements. 
#Name the three arguments that are passed into the React.createElement() function? 
* the DOM element selected, null, and whatever text or JSX inserted into the DOM.
